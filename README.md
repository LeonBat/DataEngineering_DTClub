# DataEngineering_DTClub

Hello everyone!

I am participating in the current cohort of the data engineering course of DataTalks.club this year. I am curious about the journey and hope to gain new knowledge and getting to know new people. This repository serves as a tracker for my progress but primarily also for the homework and project submissions during the course.
